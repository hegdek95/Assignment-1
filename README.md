          According to legend, tea has been known in China since about 2700 BCE.
          For millennia it was a medicinal beverage obtained by boiling fresh
          leaves in water, but around the 3rd century CE it became a daily
          drink, and tea cultivation and processing began. The first published
          account of methods of planting, processing, and drinking came in 350
          CE. Around 800 the first seeds were brought to Japan, where
          cultivation became established by the 13th century. Chinese from Amoy
          brought tea cultivation to the island of Formosa (Taiwan) in 1810. Tea
          cultivation in Java began under the Dutch, who brought seeds from
          Japan in 1826 and seeds, workers, and implements from China in 1833.
